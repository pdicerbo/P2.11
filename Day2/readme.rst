1. K- MEANS
~~~~~~~~~~~

a. Program from scratch the clustering algorithm k-means with random initialization.
b. Download the data set S3 from http://cs.uef.fi/sipu/datasets/
c. Apply the algorithm with k=15 100 times, obtain the best value of the objective
   function and the average one. Plot the assignation for the best case.
d. Implement K-means ++ initialization in your algorithm and redo point c)
e. Perform the scree plot (with k from 2 to 20) for this data set using the best value of the
   objective function.
f. (Optional) modify your k-means code for obtaining k-medoids.


2. FUZZY C - MEANS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

a. Modify k-means for obtaining c-means.
b. Perform the scree plot for the same data set.
c. Plot the assignation for the best case.
