1. DENSITY PEAKS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

a. Program from scratch the density peaks algorithm
b. Download the data set Aggregation from http://cs.uef.fi/sipu/datasets/
c. Apply the algorithm with d_c =2.5
d. Apply the algorithm to the S3 data set with d_c =57500.


2. VALIDATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

a. Apply k-means to the Aggregation data set.
b. Compare the F-ratio variance test of density peaks and k-means for the Aggregation
   Data set and for S3 data set.
c. Compare the Normalized mutual information scores for the two algorithms (k-means and density peaks) and the two data sets (Aggregation and S3).
